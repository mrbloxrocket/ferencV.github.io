                    Hi, my name is Jaywon and I'm currently a junior at Tappan Zee High School. 
                    I’ve always loved trying new things, and my passion for learning led me to computer science. 
                    The intersection of technology and business fascinates me, and I’m eager to explore more in this area.
                    I created this website entirely by myself, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                    Feel free to explore my portfolio and learn more about my achievements, passions, and interests.

                <p>
                    I joined our school's Robotics team during Freshman year and have been in the software subteam ever since.
                    I programmed a drivetrain and a climb function for our Robot. I also helped create and implement autonomous pathways for our robot. 
                    As a software lead I had to teach newer members how to program in java as well as how to program the robot.
                    I was a member of our team’s impact team and presented to judges at competition, I also presented at our

                <p>
                    During my sophomore year I started an investment club after noticing a lack of business oriented clubs at my school.
                    We started off by competing in the <a href="https://www.stockmarketgame.org/"

                <p>
                    I have secured 2 guest speakers who currently work in finance. We are planning to compete in other investment competitions and I hope 
                    to inspire and teach others the basics of investing. We are also working on a potential school trip to Wall Street, NYC.

                <p>
                    Since I was in middle school I have had the opportunity to participate in Science Olympiad.
                    I have been competing for our high school team since freshman year.
                    As the vice-president I helped organize the events students compete in and I also help students 
                    study and compete for events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have medaled in the top 10 for an event for every science olympiad competition I have competed in so far.

                    Throughout highschool I have actively participated in my schools student government.
                    Notably, through student organization I have helped organize our school's spirit week,
                    pep rally, blood drive, student body elections, and other school events.

                <p>
                    The Student Organization (S.O.) is the “voice” of the student body. S.O. acts as the 
                    liaison between the school administration and student body in issues dealing with the welfare of student life at TZHS.
                    S.O. is involved in many altruistic programs from collecting toys for Nyack Hospital to food drives for the needy.
                    S.O. truly represents the spirit of TZHS.

                    <p>
                        One of my favorite hobbies is playing tennis.
                        I have  played tennis for 4 years at my school and have been playing it for 6 years. I intially played on Junior Varsity. Starting Sophomore year I
                        played on the Varsity tennis team. I played doubles 4 and notably went undefeated that year. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have reached a peak doubles UTR rating of 5.07 and range from a 4-5 in doubles. 
                    </p>
                <h3>Taekwondo</h3>
                <p>
                    Another fun fact about me is I did Taekwondo.
                    Taekwondo is a great martial art that improves flexibility, strength, and self discipline.
                    I have done Taekwondo for 10+ years and am a Kukkiwon cerified 3rd degree black belt.
